## Introduction
Hello, my name is Kaloyan Stoykov.
I am currently interning at D-centralize B.V. in the pro6pp product. I have a passion for developing various types of applications in all business fields and also show deep interest in learning and exploring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for my future studies.

## Currently Learning
Currently learning python for a backend application, coupled with postgresql.

## Technical skills / stack
I have tried to explore many technologies in various ways like personal projects, practice exercises and general points of interests.

I am currently interning with **Python** and **postgreSQL** on a geodata transformation project for D-centralize B.V. In my free time I like to read tech newsletters, enjoy going to the gym and listening to different types of podcasts.cha
